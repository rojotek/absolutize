h1. Absolutize v0.0.1

h2. Intro 

Absolutize is essentially a replication of the URI.join or URI.merge methods, however, these strictly adhere to html standards, unfortunately the rest of the world doesn't.  The absolutize gem attempts to replicate url parsing that browsers use, ignoring the encoding issues etc.

h2. Installation

Install absolutize as a gem

bq. gem install absolutize

h2. Usage

absol = Absolutize.new(base_url)
uri = absol.url(relative_url)

h3. Methods

bq. new(base_url, options) - creates a new absolutize object based on a base_url

h4. options
  * :remove_anchors - removes any anchor tags (false)
  * :force_escaping - forces escaping of urls if it hasn't been done already (true)

bq. url(rel_url) - absolutizes the relative_url based on the base_url
